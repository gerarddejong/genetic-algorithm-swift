User stories have the following properties:
- Estimate (in days)
- Priority (1 - 10)

Sprints have the following properties:
- Length (in days)


##Additional complexity

User stories have the following properties:
- Estimate (in days)
- Priority (1 - 10)
- Dependencies (other user stories must be completated before this one can commence)

Sprints have the following properties:
- Length (in days)

Other potential problems can include: traveling salesman, Hamilton circuit, bin packing, knapsack, and clique.
